## Built With:
**HTML**

**CSS**

**JavaScript**

#### Description/Features:
To start, click the 'Start Game' button on the home screen. A random phrase will be selected and shown on the board, covered in green squares.

You will be given 5 tries to guess the correct phrase. Each life is represented at the bottom of the screen with a 'life' heart icon.

To guess a letter simply click on one of the keyboard buttons or press a button on your own keyboard. 
If your letter is contained in the phrase, it will appear on the phrase board.
If it is not contained in the phrase, you will lose a 'life'. 

Guess the phrase correctly before your lives run out to win the game!

#### Code details: 
This is my first attempt at utiliziing classes in JavaScript to built an app. There are two main classes in this app: Phrase and Game. 
Each has their own .js file to keep things neat and organized.
Within each class, there is a set of methods that control the interaction of the game.
